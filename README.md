#MyPackagedDocument

This is an example project for iOS to demonstrate how to create and load packaged based UIDocument from UIDocumentBrowserViewController.

It seems there aren't many "working" examples how to handle packaged based document, and I was having hard time, because UIDocumentBrowserViewController did not treat my package folders as a document, rather they are treated as just folders.

I just commit because I figured it is working in my environment.  There are so many try and error foot prints all over in this project.

Here is the environment when this project was made.

```
Xcode 11.1
Swift 5.1
iOS 12
```
