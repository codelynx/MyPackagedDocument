# MyPackagedDocument

This is an example project for iOS to demonstrate how to create and load packaged based UIDocument from UIDocumentBrowserViewController.

It seems there aren't so much "working" example project or codes how to handle packaged based `UIDocument`.  And I was having hard time to make it work, because `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` did not treat my package folders as a document, rather they are treated as just folders.

I just commit this project because I just made this project working.  `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` treats my folders as a document rather than a simple folder.  There are so many trys and errors on my project, and some keys and values can be removed to simplify this project.  Anyway, I check this project in before I break this project.

This project is worked on following environment:

```
Xcode 11.1
Swift 5.1
iOS 12
```
